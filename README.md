## 🚀 Coursework: "Mini-NumPy" Simulation

**Focus:** Data Structures, Scientific Computing, Memory Management

A significant academic project designed to replicate the core functionality of the standard **NumPy** library using pure Python. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of how high-performance data manipulation tools are built under the hood.

* **N-Dimensional Arrays:** Implementation of a custom `NDArray` class that handles multi-dimensional data storage and slicing.
* **Matrix Operations:** Manual implementation of dot products, transpositions, and element-wise arithmetic without relying on external libraries.
* **Broadcasting Logic:** Simulates NumPy's broadcasting rules to allow operations between arrays of different shapes.

## 🛠 Personal Projects: The Python Toolkit

A collection of self-initiated projects that apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to solve mathematical and logic problems.

### 1. The Math & Graph Core Library

A modular set of Python classes designed as a reusable backend for other applications.

* **`Matrix` Class:** A robust class for linear algebra. Supports initialization, inversion, and complex matrix multiplications.
* **`Graph` Class:** Implements an adjacency list/matrix structure to represent nodes and edges, serving as the foundation for pathfinding algorithms.
* **`FunctionCalculator` Class:** A parser capable of interpreting string-based mathematical expressions and evaluating functions dynamically.

### 2. Beijing Subway Navigation System

**Focus:** Graph Theory, Pathfinding Algorithms (Dijkstra/BFS)

A practical application built on top of the custom `Graph` class.

* **Real-world Modeling:** Maps the Beijing Subway network into a graph structure where stations are nodes and lines are edges with weights.
* **Route Planning:** Calculates the optimal route between any two stations, accounting for transfers and distance.
* **Data Visualization:** (Optional) text-based or simple visual output of the path.

### 3. Minesweeper

**Focus:** Recursion, Grid Logic, Event Handling

A fully playable Python implementation of the classic Minesweeper game.

* **Recursive Algorithms:** Uses recursion (Flood Fill) to automatically clear empty grid spaces when a safe tile is clicked.
* **State Management:** Tracks game states (Victory/Game Over), flag placement, and mine randomization.
